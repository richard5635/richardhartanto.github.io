myRoleDesc: >-
  I implemented several game designs using Unity for Hanamaru Labs educational
  app, Think-think. I interned there on a twelve hours per week basis. While
  receiving supervision from Naoki Kosaka and image resources, I implemented the
  games from scratch until they fully work. During my intern, I mainly used
  Unity's 2D Tools with minimum reliance on Physics Engine.
